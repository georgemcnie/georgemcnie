<h1 align="center">George McNie's Github</h1>
Hello I'm George, a graduate from The University of Manchester with a Master of Physics degree with Honours. I can code in Python, C++, HTML and CSS with an advanced knowledge of popular Python modules such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn and pytorch. My master's project was done in collaboration with City Football Group to carry out data analysis in the loan market to help make informed decisions on player pathways (see below). I primarily use coding for data analysis but I have also made some interesting projects in both C++ and Python. Please note that this page is a work in progress and I am in the process of uploading files so some documents are incomplete.

<h2 align="left">Coding Projects</h2>
Below is a complete list of the coding projects that I completed during my 4 years at The University of Manchester. It is worth noting that this does not include the coding work used for lab experiments, this is all included above. These projects focused on simulation, data analysis methods and making interfaces and used C++, Python and Jupyter notebooks.
